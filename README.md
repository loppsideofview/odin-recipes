TOP Recipes Project
I will use this a a reflection of what I learned for this project. 
To start, I did have to refresh my memory on setting up a repo and clone it to my machine. I am sure that will just take some time and repetition before it becomes a mindless task

Had trouble with images on the lasagna recipe. Had to leave it and come back the next day. Decided to just delete the image element add start fresh. Then, it worked!
